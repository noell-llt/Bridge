# Bridge
My Final Year Project (Bridge)

INTRODUCTION:
The aim of this project was to transform “Floating Bridge”, a card game deeply embedded in
Singapore’s cultural heritage, into a digital format. This endeavour seeks to respect and
preserve the traditional rules and strategic complexities of the game while providing a web
application that facilitates easy and familiar play.



To execute the code, it is essential to first download Unity Hub.
Once you have cloned the Git repository I uploaded, it is unclear whether Unity GameObjects will be automatically imported or if they require manual addition.

Due to time constraints, I was unable to deploy the game and thus, have only been able to test it within the Unity Hub. 
To run the game, simply press the ‘Play’ button located at the top of the Unity Hub interface.

The codes are in Assets/Scripts.
